# SkinScan
SkinScan employs deep learning CNN for skin cancer cell detection, preceded by thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visual representations.


### I'm excited to share the completion of this project, facilitated by guidance from the Kaggle platform, as I sought to deepen my understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This endeavor was driven by a keen desire to learn and master new skills, underscoring the value of platforms like Kaggle in fostering continuous learning and growth.
